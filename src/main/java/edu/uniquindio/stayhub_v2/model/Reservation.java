/**
 * Entity representing a reservation (booking) in the StayHub platform.
 *
 * <p>
 * This entity captures all details of a booking made by a guest for a specific
 * accommodation. It tracks the reservation period, pricing, and current status.
 * Reservations are the core transactional entity connecting guests with
 * accommodations.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Key Features:</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Tracks start and end dates of the stay</li>
 * <li>Stores the total price in the accommodation's currency</li>
 * <li>Maintains reservation status through {@link ReservationStatus} enum</li>
 * <li>Inherits audit timestamps from {@link Auditable}</li>
 * <li>Links guest and accommodation through many-to-one relationships</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Business Rules:</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>End date must be strictly after start date</li>
 * <li>A reservation cannot overlap with existing active reservations for the
 * same accommodation</li>
 * <li>Total price is calculated based on nights × price per night</li>
 * <li>Status transitions follow a defined lifecycle (ACTIVE →
 * COMPLETED/CANCELLED)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Relationships:</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Accommodation:</b> Many-to-One - The property being booked</li>
 * <li><b>Guest:</b> Many-to-One - The user making the reservation</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Status Lifecycle:</b>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ACTIVE → COMPLETED (after end date passes)
 * ACTIVE → CANCELLED (guest or host cancellation)
 * ACTIVE → NO_SHOW (guest doesn't arrive)
 * </pre>
