/**
 * Entity representing an accommodation listing in the StayHub platform.
 *
 * <p>This entity stores all information related to a property listed for rent,
 * including its location, pricing, capacity, and associated media. Accommodations
 * are owned by hosts and can be booked by guests through reservations.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Key Features:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Soft delete support via {@code deleted} flag</li>
 *   <li>Geolocation support with latitude/longitude coordinates</li>
 *   <li>Multiple images support via {@code @ElementCollection}</li>
 *   <li>Audit trail inherited from {@link Auditable}</li>
 *   <li>Indexed fields for optimized queries</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Database Indexes:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code idx_accommodation_deleted} - Optimizes soft-delete filtering</li>
 *   <li>{@code idx_accommodation_host} - Optimizes queries by host</li>
 *   <li>{@code idx_accommodation_lat_lon} - Optimizes geospatial searches</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Relationships:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Host:</b> Many-to-One with {@link User} (owner of the accommodation)</li>
 *   <li><b>Reservations:</b> One-to-Many with {@link Reservation} (bookings made)</li>
 *   <li><b>Images:</b> ElementCollection of image URLs</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Lifecycle:</b></p>
 * Accommodations support soft deletion. When {@code deleted = true}, the entity
 * remains in the database but should be filtered out from all user-facing queries.
 * Use the {@code available} flag to temporarily hide listings without deleting them.</p>
